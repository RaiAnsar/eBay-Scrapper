# eBay Scraper Pro - Project Documentation

## Overview
High-performance eBay scraper with real-time progress tracking, anti-bot detection, and automated data extraction.

## Server Details
- **URL**: https://ebay.mediatronixs.com
- **Server IP**: 46.202.195.247
- **SSH Key**: `~/.ssh/vps`
- **Server Path**: `/var/www/ebay-scraper/`
- **Process Manager**: PM2 (process name: `ebay-scraper`)
- **Port**: 3001 (reverse proxied through Nginx)

## Key Features
- Real-time WebSocket communication for live progress updates
- Task queue system with MAX_CONCURRENT_BROWSERS = 1 to prevent crashes
- Bot detection handling with automatic 2-minute pause
- EAN and Description extraction from product pages
- XLSX export with formatted data
- Duplicate removal and sponsored item filtering
- UK-only filtering option

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **server_advanced.js** - Main server with ScraperTask class
2. **web_interface_minimal.html** - Modern UI with real-time updates
3. **results.html** - Download page for completed scrapes
4. **robots.txt** - Blocks all bots from indexing

### Key Technologies
- **Puppeteer** with stealth plugin for anti-detection
- **WebSocket** for bidirectional communication
- **Express.js** server
- **PM2** for process management
- **Nginx** with Let's Encrypt SSL

## Known Issues & Solutions

### EAN/Description Extraction
- **Primary selector**: `.item-description` for descriptions
- Creates separate browser page for each product to avoid frame detachment
- Fixed skip logic to check both EAN and Description independently

### eBay Limitations
- Hard limit of ~7,500 products per search query
- Rate limiting triggers bot detection after rapid scraping
- Automatic 2-minute pause when bot detection triggered

## Deployment Commands

### Deploy Changes
```bash
# Copy files to server (no Git on production)
scp -i ~/.ssh/vps server_advanced.js root@46.202.195.247:/var/www/ebay-scraper/
scp -i ~/.ssh/vps web_interface_minimal.html root@46.202.195.247:/var/www/ebay-scraper/

# Restart PM2 process
ssh -i ~/.ssh/vps root@46.202.195.247 "pm2 restart ebay-scraper"
```

### Monitor Server
```bash
# Check PM2 status
ssh -i ~/.ssh/vps root@46.202.195.247 "pm2 status"

# View logs
ssh -i ~/.ssh/vps root@46.202.195.247 "pm2 logs ebay-scraper --lines 50"

# Check debug log
ssh -i ~/.ssh/vps root@46.202.195.247 "tail -f /var/www/ebay-scraper/debug.log"
```

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# If scraper crashes
ssh -i ~/.ssh/vps root@46.202.195.247 "pm2 restart ebay-scraper"

# If server runs out of memory
ssh -i ~/.ssh/vps root@46.202.195.247 "pm2 stop ebay-scraper && pm2 flush && pm2 start ebay-scraper"
```

## Recent Fixes (Aug 29, 2025)

1. **Fixed WebSocket disconnections**
   - Added ping/pong handler to keep connection alive
   - Client sends ping every 30 seconds
   - Server responds with pong

2. **Optimized Description extraction**
   - Now uses direct URL: `https://itm.ebaydesc.com/itmdesc/{ITEM_ID}`
   - Much faster than navigating to product pages
   - Filters out shipping/contact info, only product descriptions
   - Also extracts EAN from description pages (like HMV includes it)

3. **Fixed progress updates**
   - Shows all items (60/60) instead of stopping at 56/60
   - Added condition for last item in extraction loop
   - Final progress update after loop completion

4. **Previous fixes**
   - Changed from OR to AND logic for checking existing data
   - Added `.item-description` as primary selector
   - Each product now uses separate browser page
   - Task queue system prevents concurrent browser crashes
