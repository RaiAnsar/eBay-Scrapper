# eBay Scraper Fixes - Complete Summary

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Page Detection Limited to 10 Pages**
**Problem:** Scraper was hardcoded to return 10 pages if detection failed
**Fix:** 
- Changed default fallback from 10 to 50 pages
- Added detection for "Next" button to continue pagination
- Implemented `scrape_url_with_continuation()` method that continues beyond detected pages
- Now properly calculates pages based on total results (handles 200 items/page vs 60)

### 2. ✅ **Max Pages Limitation**
**Problem:** Constructor defaulted to max 50 pages
**Fix:** 
- Changed `max_pages` default to `None` (unlimited)
- When None, sets to 99999 effectively removing the limit

### 3. ✅ **EAN Extraction Limited to 100 Products**
**Problem:** Code had `all_products[:100]` limiting EAN extraction
**Fix:**
- Removed the 100 product limit
- Implemented batch processing (10 products at a time) to prevent resource exhaustion
- Added progress updates every 100 products
- Added 0.5s delay between batches to prevent overload

### 4. ✅ **No Continuation Beyond Visible Pages**
**Problem:** eBay only shows ~10,000 results even if 700K+ exist
**Fix:** Added two new methods:
- `scrape_url_with_continuation()`: Intelligently continues scraping beyond detected pages
- `scrape_large_dataset()`: Uses price segmentation to access all products

### 5. ✅ **700K+ Products Issue**
**Problem:** eBay caps visible results at ~10,000 items
**Fix:** Implemented price segmentation strategy:
- Splits searches into 14 price ranges (£0-5, £5-10, etc.)
- Each segment can return up to 10,000 products
- Deduplicates by eBay ID to avoid duplicates
- Can theoretically access 140,000+ products

## New Features Added

### 1. **Intelligent Continuation**
```python
async def scrape_url_with_continuation(url, extract_details=False, continue_on_empty=True)
```
- Continues scraping even when page numbers disappear
- Checks for more content beyond initial detection
- Stops only after 3 consecutive empty pages
- Safety limit of 500 pages

### 2. **Large Dataset Handling**
```python
async def scrape_large_dataset(base_search, use_segmentation=True)
```
- Uses price range segmentation
- Handles deduplication
- Provides segment-by-segment progress
- Can access far more than the 10,000 item limit

### 3. **Improved Resource Management**
- Batch processing for EAN extraction (10 at a time)
- Periodic garbage collection
- Progress updates to track long-running jobs
- Delays between batches to prevent overload

## API Updates

### New Request Parameters:
```python
class ScrapeRequest(BaseModel):
    urls: List[str]
    extract_details: bool = False
    max_pages: Optional[int] = None  # No limit by default
    use_continuation: bool = True    # Continue beyond detected pages
    use_segmentation: bool = False   # Use price segmentation for large datasets
```

## How to Use

### For Normal Scraping (up to 10,000 products):
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/scrape" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "urls": ["https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=blu+ray&_ipg=200"],
    "extract_details": true,
    "use_continuation": true
  }'
```

### For Large Datasets (700K+ products):
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/scrape" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "urls": ["https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=blu+ray"],
    "use_segmentation": true,
    "extract_details": false
  }'
```

## Performance Expectations

- **Without EAN extraction**: ~200 products/page, ~5-10 seconds/page
- **With EAN extraction**: ~10 products/minute due to individual page visits
- **Segmentation mode**: Can get 100,000+ products in a few hours
- **Continuation mode**: Will keep going until no more products found

## Remaining Limitations

1. **eBay's Hard Limit**: Even with segmentation, eBay may not show all 700K products
2. **Selector Issues**: Currently finding fewer products per page than expected (needs selector update)
3. **Resource Usage**: EAN extraction still resource-intensive for large datasets
4. **Time**: Scraping 700K products would take days even if all were accessible

## Recommendations

1. **For Quick Results**: Use without EAN extraction first
2. **For Complete Dataset**: Use segmentation mode with multiple price ranges
3. **For EAN Data**: Run EAN extraction as a separate batch job on already-collected products
4. **Monitor Progress**: Check logs regularly for long-running jobs

The scraper is now significantly improved and can handle large-scale scraping, though getting all 700K products remains challenging due to eBay's limitations.
